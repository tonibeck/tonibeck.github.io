      <description>Objectives In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how a unifi wireless controller can be deployed in Azure. Overall goal here was to have a lightweight, efficient yet very capable home network. I wanted to reduce the number of boxes I have to a minimum - So only things that remained on-prem are a compact PoE Router (Unifi Edge Router PoE) and three Unifi Access Points (two pros and one light.)
Goals  Minimum number of boxes required Energy efficient High performance Easy to manage Modern and cool :-)  First things first - the Azure resources have to be deployed.</description>
