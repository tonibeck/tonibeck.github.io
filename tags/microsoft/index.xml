      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can hardly believe it, but almost one year has already gone by since I started at Microsoft. 
In this post I would like to give an insight into how my first year went. I can say in advance that it was a complete success and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have made this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following I will give a brief insight into hiring, onboarding, the role of the Cloud Solution Architect and the learning and growth opportunities within Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The year 2020 is an exciting year as it brings a few new things for me - including a professional change. Long story short, after a couple of years with Cisco in the networking space, I have decided to make a shift towards cloud. I got the chance to join Microsoft into the role of a Cloud Solution Architect within the Customer Success Unit in Munich. And guess what, I took it :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
