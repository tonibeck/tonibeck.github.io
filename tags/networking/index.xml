      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went through the professional certification from Aviatrix. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way for all IT professionals to expand their knowledge in Cloud Infrastructure and Networking. The certification is valuable for all roles, whether at a systems integrator or partner, end customer, or as a technical role at a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cloud market is developing at great speed. I had two great, successful years as a Solution Architect at Microsoft. Microsoft has a fantastic team, great customers and outstanding momentum with Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great time with personal growth and definitely a whole lot of learnings. In 2022, however, I have decided to take the experience I have gained and transfer into a new role at Aviatrix in EMEA. Here is why I think this is the right move.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
